  ## Installation

  You can git clone my repository to have a local copy on your machine and be sure to install node.js and install the inquirer package with npm install inquirer

  ## Usage

  within your terminal or CLI with Node.js installed you will execute the file with the command "node app.js" and run through the on screen prompts to create your team members.

  When you are finished adding employees answer either yes to add more employees or no to the final question to end the process. Once you end the process your HTML file will be generated!

  ## Testing

  Clone my repository to have a local copy on your machine and be sure to install node.js and the inquirer package as well.

  For some additional testing you can run "npm run test" to test my test suites to see them pass.

  To do this you'll first need to install jest by running "npm install jest" which is the testing framework I used.
